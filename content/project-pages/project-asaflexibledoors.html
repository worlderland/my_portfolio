        <p>This project is a restyling of the existing website, that was made years ago by one of the ladies working in
          the office.</p>
        <p>It uses the latest version of Wordpress, along with the theme Ocean WP, a famous one in the web design world
          because of its nice and clean looking as well as its compatibility with Elementor, a drag-n-drop plugin that
          makes the life of the average user very easy when creating/modifying a website.</p>
        <p>The reason behind this choice was indeed to try to keep it as much easy as possible for someone with limited
          web design knowledge to be able to maintain/modify the website in the future.</p>
        <p>This project is still a prototype, and it has not been published because of the lack of content as well as the lack of time to create it.</p>
