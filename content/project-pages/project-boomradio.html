        <p>This project was assigned to me and 2 other my class mates as a group (<a href="https://www.myjamjar.com.au/" target="blank">John Robertson</a> and <a
          href="https://www.shedesign.dev/" target="blank">Fanny Lefert</a>) at the beginning of our Diploma of Website Development class</p>
        <p>Taking advantage of the skills we gained the year before during our Cert. IV in Web Based Technologies class and after interviewing the client, we quickly dove into the design of this website. Therefore in the semester, while following our assessments, we delivered a fully functional HTML/CSS prototype based on CSS grid framework Foundation 6 (using their brand new XY grid) and SCSS.</p>
        <p>Then, after the winter break we dove into Wordpress and we spent time during the following 6 months to turn the prototype we had previously created into a theme. We worked really hard as a group, democratically taking decisions about anything in regards to the project. And we are very proud of the result we achieved.</p>
        <p>During our last meeting with the client, we had such a glorious feedback from each individual taking part to the presentation, even if they will not be using it, because as us, they will be graduating this year.</p>
