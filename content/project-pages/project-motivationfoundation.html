        <p>This project represents one of the biggest challenges during my 2 years at TAFE.</p>
        <p>Basically one morning our Lecturer told us we were going to have a "guest" speaking in the class; Tim walked
          in and after a short introduction, he explained us his project. At the end of the presentation (that was
          actually a website he wished to have built by students) we were asked who was keen to jump in and take over
          it; in that moment 5 of us just looked into each others eyes and said "yes!, we'll do it!" (or at least try).
        </p>
        <p>Long story short, one of the best groups I have ever worked in was born.</p>
        <p>Although we were only attending our Cert. IV in Web Based Technologies class, we had plenty of curiosity and
          thirst of knowledge. After the first step of interviewing the client to understand their needs, we all went
          through the design process, from wireframes to mockups, from prototypes to Wordpress.</p>
        <p>The choice of Wordpress and the theme Ocean WP (a famous one in the web design world
          because of its nice and clean looking as well as its compatibility with Elementor, a drag-n-drop plugin that
          makes the life of the average user very easy when creating/modifying a website) was indeed to try to keep it as much simple as possible for someone with limited
          web design knowledge to be able to maintain/modify the website in the future.</p>
        <p>The Motivation Foundation is the result of our hard co-work, during our summer holidays.</p>
