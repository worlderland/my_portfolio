        <p>This project represents the second final assessment for the class "Complex UX Design", where we were asked to follow some specifications and guidelines to produce a fully working website while using Foundation framework and SCSS. Specifically this project uses Foundation 6 and its brand new XY grid.</p>
        <p>This also incleded a previous development of a fully working prototype based on the exact same technologies.</p>
