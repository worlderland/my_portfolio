        <p>This project started more or less a year ago, when after an indoor soccer match one of my friends approached me asking some advice regarding the possibility of developing a website for his brand new and growing business.</p>
        <p>At that time I was only attending the Cert. IV in Web Based Technologies class, therefore my knowledge was very limited; after some researches I have done I chose Wordpress as developing platform. Its ease of use and the large amount of online tutorials made it a great choice. I have also chosen the theme (Shopisle) after researching online for themes compatible with WooCommerce, the most famous e-commerce plugin for WP.</p>
        <p>So why WooCommerce? Well, while discussing the project with my friend, it came out that somewhere along the line he would not exclude to have an online shop for his hand made Italian food products. This is the main reason that guided me in the choice of the theme as well as in the setup of WooCommerce's catalog mode.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this project is still a prototype, because of what similarly happened to <a href="../project_asaflexibledoors.php" target="blank">ASA Flexible Doors</a>, there is not much time to dedicate to content creation.</p>
