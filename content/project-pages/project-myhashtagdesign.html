        <p>This project is a favour I made for a very close friend of mine; she has a great passion about interior
          design as well as writing. When she wanted to join them 2, My Hashtag Design was born.</p>
        <p>My role in this project had been to go through all the steps someone new to the web world needed to know; therefore, as a consultant, I started from the beginning setting her up on my server to make her familiar with Wordpress (probably the best CMS for Bloggers on today's market), explaining her what was needed. I took her through the millions of themes, giving her few guidelines about how to pick one (and that means not only how pretty it looks...).</p>
        <p>She is now devoted to her blog and every time she has some spare time, she sits down, writes and updates it.</p>
