        <p>Worlderland began as what our HTML/CSS Lecturer calls "Pet Project" During my Cert. IV in Web Based
            Technologies class. I have designed and developed this website from scratches, literally from the first line
            of HTML to the last one of CSS. Yes, no frameworks involved.</p>
        <p>It is is also yet to become my personal travel blog, which I will be probably be working on in the
            near future.</p>
        <p>I will base it on Wordpress (as it is probably the best CMS for blogging as per today), in fact I am still researching for the right theme as well as for some time to create content.</p>
        <p>It will represent a dream come true as I always wanted a travel blog to talk about my travels as well as keep my memories.</p>
